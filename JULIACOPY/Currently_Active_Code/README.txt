README:		For all currently active Summer 2019 NSERC-USRA Folder Program files

AUTHORS:	Julia Cai, Alexa de Grandmont

LAST UPDATE:	August 12th, 2019

LANGUAGE:	PYTHON
VERSION:	3 and above

ISSUES:		1) Python2 causes float division to become integer division
		2) Python2 causes the terminal input to require quotation marks
			around user input or else it will cause a runtime error
		3) Python3/Ubuntu/Something/??? doesn't like having to import and
			use modules with '+' in the module/program/file name; causes
			syntax error during runtime

Current_Active_Code directory:
	Contains:
	
	NN Directory:
		Contains:
		
		All files related to the Nearest Neighbor Problem and the
		Simple Randomized Algorithm from the related CCCG 2019 Paper.

	NN2 Directory:
		Contains:

		All files related to the Modified Box Version (NN2) of the implementation
		of the Simple Randomized Algorithm from the related CCCG 2019
		Paper. Based on a Constrained Box Version of the orignal program (NN),
		contained in the NN directory.

	NN3 Directory:
		Contains:
		
		All files related to the 3D Version (NN3) of the implementation of the
		Simple Randomized Algorithm from the related CCCG 2019 Paper. Based on
		a 3D extension version of the original program (NN) contained in the
		NN directory.

	NN4 Directory:
		Contains:
		
		All files related to the 3D Conjecture Testing Version (NN4) of the 
		implementation of the Simple Randomized Algorithm from the related 
		CCCG 2019 Paper. A Conjecture Testing extension version of the 
		3D version of the program (NN3) contained in the NN3 directory.


	NN5 Directory:
		Contains:

		All files related to the 4D Conjecture Testing Version (NN5) of the 
		implementation of the Simple Randomized Algorithm from the related 
		CCCG 2019 Paper. A 4D Conjecture Testing version of the program.
		WARNING: Still under development and has implementation errors
