README:		For all currently active Summer 2019 NSERC-USRA Folder Program files

AUTHORS:	Julia Cai, Alexa de Grandmont

LAST UPDATE:	July 11th, 2019

LANGUAGE:	PYTHON
VERSION:	3 and above

ISSUES:		1) Python2 causes float division to become integer division
		2) Python2 causes the terminal input to require quotation marks
			around user input or else it will cause a runtime error
		3) Python3/Ubuntu/Something/??? doesn't like having to import and
			use modules with '+' in the module/program/file name; causes
			syntax error during runtime
