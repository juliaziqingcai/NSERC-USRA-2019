README:		For all currently active Summer 2019 NSERC-USRA Folder Program files

AUTHORS:	Julia Cai, Alexa de Grandmont

LAST UPDATE:	June 12th, 2019

LANGUAGE:	PYTHON
VERSION:	3 and above

ISSUES:		1) Python2 causes float division to become integer division
		2) Python2 causes the terminal input to require quotation marks
			around user input or else it will cause a runtime error
		3) Python3/Ubuntu/Something/??? doesn't like having to import and
			use modules with '+' in the module/program/file name; causes
			syntax error during runtime

Best_K_Test_Results.ods:
	Spreadsheet containing all test results from Binary Search for a Best K


Binary_Search_Best_K.py:
	Searches for a k lower than a theoretical upper bound through Binary Search. 
	Contains many overnight test runs


EstimateN.py:
	The culmination of all our work during the six weeks from May 1, 2019
	to June 10 2019. The function NewEstimateN is the final and most correct
	base version (no speed upgrades) of our algorithm to approximate n
	with only confirmation sampling. 


Original_Test_Results_Compilation.ods:
	A compilation of original test results from overnight tests without the analysis parts.


README.txt:
	Files gives a quick overview of directory contents.


Sampling_Until_Duplicate.py:
	Algorithm for duplicate confirmation sampling.


Subprocess_Practice.py:
	A file for learning and practicing the module.
